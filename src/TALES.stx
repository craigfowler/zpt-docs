Template Attribute Language Expression Syntax

  TALES is the recommended syntax for [TAL] expressions.
  It is an extensible syntax that allows you to define any number of
  expression types and use them together. 

  See [TALES Specification 1.3] for the current implementation specification.

  See DiscussTALES for discussion of proposals for the next specification.
