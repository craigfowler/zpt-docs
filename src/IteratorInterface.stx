An iterator keeps track of the current state of a TAL repetition statement,
and updates the local variable associated with it.

Methods:

  next() -- advance to the next repetition. Returns true until the iterator
  is exhausted, then returns false.

  number() -- returns the number of the current repetition, counting up
  from one.

  start() -- return true during the first repetition, otherwise false.

  end() -- return true during the last repetition, otherwise false.
