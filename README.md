# Archived ZPT docs

This repo is nothing more than an archive.
Because I have [an interest in Zope Page Templates](https://github.com/csf-dev/ZPT-Sharp), I am keen to preserve a copy of the docs.
I am not planning on modifying the docs here.

## Original README content

This project houses the documentation for the markup languages implemented in Zope Page Templates, including the specifications and related exposition.
These documents were previously hosted in the erstwhile ZPT wiki in the zope.org family of sites.
